Week 11/23 - 11/29

what we've done :
 Pseudo code write out (view attached document on github named pseudo code)\


Week 11/30 - 12/06

What we've done :

Wrote out BFS_Traversal and AVL_TREE. 

To Do:

1. PageRank algorithm
2. Dijkstra's algorithm
3. main file (using the dataset to actually procure results)
4. create test cases to verify results
5. Compiler errors/ figuring out how to compile the executable

Week 12/07 - 12/11

What we've done :

Finished BFS_Traversal using AVL_TREE

Finished Dijkstra Algorithm using Graph

Finished PageRank Algorithm using Graph

Finished a function to parse the Data into a graph

Generated test cases using txt files

Tested on EWS to make sure the code runs
